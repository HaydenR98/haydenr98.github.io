When designing my personal web portfolio, I chose a dark color scheme with hints of orange and 
teal. This gives the website a modern look that suits my creativity and style.
I decided to use only HTML and CSS to develop the site; although I considered using bootstrap 
I felt I could create a more unique look and have little experience with 
bootstrap. Creating a nice looking mobile menu was something I struggled with during the development,
I wanted to create a nice hamburger menu for mobile and a simple navigation bar for tablet and desktop.
I decided to create a hamburger menu icon for mobile view that takes the user to another page
when clicked. On this page there would be the 4 simple navigation buttons with the logo and "back"
button. This page contains  no photos so the load time shuld feel almost instant. When the viewport
extends into tablet view the mobile navigation becomes invisible (visibility: hidden;) and the row
navigation becomes visible. When creating this web portfolio I learned how to display my work and
got a sense of what website style suits my work.
